    "In Steady-state Equilibrium (StE) in the model, in any given period, a consumer in state $s$ (which comprises liquid assets $m$, illiquid assets $k$, and human capital $\\newcommand{hLev}{h}\\hLev$) has two key choices:\n",

    "1. Contingent on that choice, decide the level of consumption, yielding consumption functions:\n",

    "#### Representing the consumer's problem with Basis Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to find an efficient \"compressed\" representation of our functions (e.g., the consumption function), which BL do using tools originally developed for image compression.  The analogy to image compression is that nearby pixels are likely to have identical or very similar colors, so we need only to find an efficient way to represent how the colors _change_ from one pixel to nearby ones.  Similarly, consumption at a given point $s_{i}$ is likely to be close to consumption point at another point $s_{j}$ that is \"close\" in the state space (similar wealth, income, etc), so a function that captures that similarity efficiently can preserve most of the information without keeping all of the points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like linear interpolation, the [DCT transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform) is a method of representing a continuous function using a finite set of numbers. It uses a set of independent [basis functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_function) to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it turns out that some of those basis functions are much more important than others in representing the steady-state functions. Dimension reduction is accomplished by basically ignoring all basis functions that make \"small enough\" contributions to the representation of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When might this go wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the consumption function changes in a recession in ways that change behavior radically at some states.  Like, suppose unemployment almost never happens in steady state, but it can happen in temporary recessions.  Suppose further that, even for employed people, in a recession, _worries_ about unemployment cause many of them to prudently withdraw some of their illiquid assets -- behavior opposite of what people in the same state would be doing during expansions.  In that case, the basis functions that represented the steady state function would have had no incentive to be able to represent well the part of the space that is never seen in steady state, so any functions that might help do so might well have been dropped in the dimension reduction stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the whole, it seems unlikely that this kind of thing is a major problem, because the vast majority of the variation that people experience is idiosyncratic.  There is always unemployment, for example; it just moves up and down a bit with aggregate shocks, but since the experience of unemployment is in fact well represented in the steady state the method should have no trouble capturing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the method might have more trouble is in representing economies in which there are multiple equilibria in which behavior is quite different."

(For an illustration of how the assumptions used when modeling asset price distributions using copulas can fail see [Salmon](https://www.wired.com/2009/02/wp-quant/))\n",

    "   * A copula is a representation of the joint distribution expressed using a mapping between the uniform joint CDF and the marginal distributions of the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The crucial assumption is that what aggregate shocks do is to squeeze or distort the steady state distribution, but leave the rank structure of the distribution the same\n",
    "      * An example of when this might not hold is the following.  Suppose that in expansions, the people at the top of the distribution of illiquid assets (the top 1 percent, say) are also at the top 1 percent of liquid assets. But in recessions the bottom 99 percent get angry at the top 1 percent of illiquid asset holders and confiscate part of their liquid assets (the illiquid assets can't be confiscated quickly because they are illiquid). Now the people in the top 99 percent of illiquid assets might be in the _bottom_ 1 percent of liquid assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this case we just need to represent how the mapping from ranks into levels of assets\n",
    "\n",
    "- This reduces the number of points for which we need to track transitions from $3600 = 30 \\times 30 \\times 4$ to $64 = 30+30+4$.  Or the total number of points we need to contemplate goes from $3600^2 \\approx 13 $million to $64^2=4096$."
